# Ram Munchies

Ram Munchies is a low-powered website that looks like a regular website (sort of). However, if you click anywhere, it will start crashing your browser/computer. Works really well with Unix based computers, but no so well with Windows. Have fun with it with your friends. If you want to try out its sister application, Ram Munchers, check it out on <a href=https://github.com/rnucuta/rammunchers" target="_blank">Github</a>.
